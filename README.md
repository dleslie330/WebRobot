# WebRobot
Our Microcontrollers project where we are building and programming a robot to be controlled over a wifi connection

What is here:
    Outline of code that works with Dakota's D-O bot from lab 14

    Use README.md to share resources, track progress, break up tasks, and
    up-date the group

TO-DO:
    learn how to wifi with the Pico

    code basic wifi functionality to see what data is like and how we want to
    interface with robot controlls

    build code for computer wifi interface with bot

    get the robot moving from controls sent over wifi
